//+++++++++ Start Here! All problems are below. +++++++++//

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////

//Write a function called dragonMapper that takes in an
//array and maps over each element, adding the string
//'...here be dragons' to the end of each element.
//dragonMapper should return the the new array. You should
//use the built-in array method .map

//Code here

const dragonMapper = (array) => array.map((e) => `${e}...here be dragons`);

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

//Write a function called cookieLoversOnly that takes
//in an array and filters out every object that
//does NOT have the key favoriteCookie.
//cookieLoversOnly should return the filtered array.

//Code here

const cookieLoversOnly = (arr) =>
  arr.filter((e) => e.hasOwnProperty("favoriteCookie"));

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////

//Write a function called changeValue that takes
//in an array, and a callback function.
//changeValue should invoke the callback function
//for every element in the array.
//changeValue should pass the current element into
//the callback function as an argument every time it is invoked.
//Hint: there is an array method for this.

//Code here

const changeValue = (arr, cb) => {
  arr.forEach((e) => {
    cb(e);
  });
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////

//Write a function called findProduct that takes in
//an array, and uses .reduce to find the product of
//the elements (here the word product means the result
//of multiplying all the elements together)
//Return the product.

//Code here

const findProduct = (arr) => arr.reduce((acc, e) => acc * e, 1);

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////

//Write a function called cipherize that takes in
//an array, and a string. It should use the
//array method .indexOf to find the index of the passed-in
//string in the array. Then, it should use the method .charAt
//to find the character at that index, in the string.
//Return that character.

//EX: cipherize(["hello", "world", "wide", "web"], "wide")
// index of string in the array: 2
// character at index 2 of "wide": "d"
// cipherize will return: "d"

//Code here

const cipherize = (arr, string) => {
  const index = arr.indexOf(string);
  return string.charAt(index);
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////

//Write a function called reverseMe that takes in
//a string, reverses it, and returns the reversed
//string. Use built-in methods for taking the string
//apart, reversing it, and putting it back together again.

//Code here

const reverseMe = (string) => {
  const split = string.split("");
  const reverse = split.reverse();
  const join = reverse.join("");
  return join;
};
